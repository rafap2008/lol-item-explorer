# **App Name**: LoL Item Explorer

## Core Features:

- Data Fetching: Fetches item data from the League of Legends API (https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/15.14.1/data/en_US/item.json).
- Grid Display: Displays item data in a sortable grid with columns for name, description, value, and icon.
- Sorting: Allows users to sort the grid by any column (name, description, value).
- Filtering: Implements filtering by name and/or description.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#303030) to evoke the strategic depth of the game in a dark theme.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) for a modern dark interface.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) to highlight important details and interactive elements, reminiscent of in-game currency, in a dark theme.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for both headlines and body text.
- Use the original item icons provided by the API for clear identification.
- Grid layout to present item details in an organized and responsive manner.
- Subtle animations when sorting or filtering the grid to provide feedback.
